# Pull request guidelines

[GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
are a great way for everyone in the community to contribute to the LANager
project. Found a bug? Just fix it in your fork and submit a pull request.
This will then be reviewed, and, if found as good, merged into the main repository.

**Please note:** This repository (`zeropingheroes/lanager`) is the bootstrapped install version, and doesn't include or track the core project code. All forks, issues and pull requests relevant to the core functionality and not this install version should be submitted to [`zeropingheroes/lanager-core`](https://github.com/zeropingheroes/lanager-core).
